## Section 1: Capacitors
1. In this experiment, the capacitor is connected in series with a resistor to the 5V power source. After the capacitor receives the charge, it is disconnected from the power supply circuit and quickly moved to another circuit consisting of only the capacitor and an LED. The LED shines brightly for a few moments before it begins fading as the capacitor loses its charge.
When the capacitor is finished charging, its voltage remains at 5V. This is because the capacitor inherits the voltage of the source it was charged from.
 2. Based on the amount of time the current reads above zero on the handheld DMM, the time to charge is less than 1 second. Upon being plugged into the LED, there is a brief flash also lasting less than 1 second. However, the LED continues to emit light, that gradually reduces in intensity, the time until the LED is no longer emitting any noticeable light was measured as 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
 3. Regardless of the position of the red lead, the DMM could only detect a current when the dial was set to 10A. When the capacitor is connected to the power supply, the DMM briefly reads 0.01A, or 10mA. When the capacitor is connected to the led, the capacitor only display 0.00A on the 10A setting.
